# ProjectCerberus
A multi-headed monster, probably going to include several projects within one, and use as sort of a development environment for several projects as we go along, then probably branch off certain projects as they outgrow their foundation. This project should not be taken seriously as it is in a sense, an incubator.


# [ProjectCerberus](https://github.com/sprtn/ProjectCerberus)

A project by Vegard Pihl Bratteng for the creation of a DnD character and spellbook management application, dependencies and derivatives.

## Getting Started

To get ProjectCerberus up and running locally, you will need to run it through Microsoft Visual Studio. I am using the 2017 version.
You might also need to be on an operating system that allows MariaDB to run if installing a later version. I do want to move the project to the web after completing the MVP.
