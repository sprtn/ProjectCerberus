# [ProjectCerberus](https://github.com/sprtn/ProjectCerberus)

A project by Vegard Pihl Bratteng for the creation of a tabletop rpg character and spellbook management application, dependencies and derivatives. Currently Dungeons and Dragons 5e values will be supported, but the project shall be free to modify, and the user shall be granted the freedom to remove all pre-written database information and create their own, either by writing the code themselves as the project is under an MIT license, free of use and free to modify as you deem fit, or by the built-in "manager" pages, e.g. the spellforge for spells and similar functionality.

## Getting Started

To get ProjectCerberus up and running locally, you will need to run it through Microsoft Visual Studio. I am using the 2017 version.
You might also need to be on an operating system that allows MariaDB to run if installing a later version. I do want to move the project to the web after completing the MVP.
