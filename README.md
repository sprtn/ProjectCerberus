# [ProjectCerberus](https://github.com/sprtn/ProjectCerberus)

A project by Vegard Pihl Bratteng for the creation of a DnD character and spellbook management application, dependencies and derivatives.

## Getting Started

To get ProjectCerberus up and running locally, you will need to run it through Microsoft Visual Studio. I am using the 2017 version.
You might also need to be on an operating system that allows MariaDB to run if installing a later version. I do want to move the project to the web after completing the MVP.
